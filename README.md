# Node.js Twitter Bot

This is a basic twitter bot that will allow you to retweet items based on a search string. It will also respond to users who follow it with a short message. It is based on the walkthroughs found [here](https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-5b14eb006c08) and [here](https://community.risingstack.com/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-node-js/).

I use a dotenv file to avoid the security risk of displaying my Twitter app credentials online. Please create a .env file in your project's home directory and populate it with your credentials.
